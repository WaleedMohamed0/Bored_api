### Overview
This project aims to demonstrate API testing using the [Bored API](https://www.boredapi.com/) with Cucumber, JUnit, and Rest Assured. The Bored API provides suggestions for activities when one is bored, and this project ensures that the API endpoints behave as expected by executing automated tests.

### Features
- Automated testing of Bored API endpoints.
- Integration of Cucumber for behavior-driven development (BDD) style testing.
- Utilization of JUnit for test execution and reporting.
- Implementation of Rest Assured for making HTTP requests and validating responses.
